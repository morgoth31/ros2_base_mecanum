# Yahboom Rosmaster Docking

This folder contains the `yahboom_rosmaster_docking` package, which provides the functionality for the robot to dock with a charging station.

## Purpose

The `yahboom_rosmaster_docking` package is responsible for the robot's docking behavior. It contains the nodes that implement the docking logic, and the launch files for starting the docking process.

## Key Files

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the docking nodes.
- `launch/`: This directory contains the launch files for starting the docking process.

## Adaptation

To adapt this folder to your needs, you would typically modify the docking logic in the source files to match your docking station's configuration. You might also modify the launch files to change the docking process's startup behavior.
