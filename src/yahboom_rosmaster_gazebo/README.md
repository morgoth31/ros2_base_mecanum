# Yahboom Rosmaster Gazebo

This folder contains the Gazebo simulation environment for the Yahboom Rosmaster robot.

## Purpose

The `yahboom_rosmaster_gazebo` package provides the files needed to simulate the Yahboom Rosmaster robot in Gazebo. This includes the world files, models, and launch files.

## Key Files

- `worlds/`: This directory contains the Gazebo world files.
- `models/`: This directory contains the Gazebo models for the robot and other objects in the environment.
- `launch/`: This directory contains the launch files for starting the Gazebo simulation.
- `config/ros_gz_bridge.yaml`: This file configures the bridge between ROS and Gazebo.

## Adaptation

To adapt this folder to your needs, you would typically modify the world files to change the simulation environment. You might also modify the launch files to change the simulation's startup behavior.
