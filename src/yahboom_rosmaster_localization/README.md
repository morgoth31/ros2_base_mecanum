# Yahboom Rosmaster Localization

This folder contains the `yahboom_rosmaster_localization` package, which provides the functionality for the robot to localize itself in its environment.

## Purpose

The `yahboom_rosmaster_localization` package is responsible for the robot's localization. It contains the nodes that implement the localization logic, and the launch files for starting the localization process.

## Key Files

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the localization nodes.
- `launch/`: This directory contains the launch files for starting the localization process.

## Adaptation

To adapt this folder to your needs, you would typically modify the localization logic in the source files to match your environment's configuration. You might also modify the launch files to change the localization process's startup behavior.
